# pokedex-reactivex

This is a port of Pokedex app from the udemy [course](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios10) from imperative code to FRP based code using RxSwift, RxAlamofire, RxCocoa and SwiftyJSON for parsing JSON. It also follows the MVVM pattern for which I got a head start from the following blog post https://medium.cobeisfresh.com/implementing-mvvm-in-ios-with-rxswift-updated-for-swift-2-51cc3ef7edb3#.s3iky3sdx.

This a good reference point for beginners as an intro into RxSwift or Reactive Programming as I am a beginner myself.
